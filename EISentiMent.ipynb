    "* As unemployment rate is one of the most important economic indicators, this exploratory analysis uses this indicator, but additional indicators will be added as features to the model as they are proven relevant. We retrieved historical data on unemployment rates from the [U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNU04000000). This data reflects normal revisions in the months following the original announcements and is not seasonally adjusted.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* Because the historical unemployment data above has been revised after the original announcement, and we are considering the impact of the announcements, we retrieved the original text of the documents released on the first Friday of each month for the last ten years. The links to locations of these documents are found on the [Employment Situation Archived News Releases page](https://www.bls.gov/bls/news-release/empsit.htm).  \n",
    "\n",
    "* We are using the components of the S&P500 Index as our securities sample for this exploratory analysis. Other securities such as bonds and future contracts can be added later for a more complete picture. Because Standard and Poor doesn't publish an official list of the index constituents, we will be using a dataset from [DataHub](https://datahub.io/core/s-and-p-500-companies/r/constituents.csv) as a relevant and accurate enough unofficial list for sampling purposes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* We will be retrieving daily price and volume data for the list of ~500 stocks from [Tiingo](https://www.tiingo.com) using their RESTful API.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* Finally, we will be extracting historical data from [Twitter](https://twitter.com/home?lang=en) using their full archive API to extract market sentiment data on release dates.  "
